# Final Project Assignment - Data Exploration

This repository wrangles data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics on US-Canada and US-Mexico border crossings from 1996 to present (2024). The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the rate of personal (non-freight or commercial) border crossings over time to understand how certain policy decisions or world events has effected the rate of crossings.
