# Final Project Assignment - Data Exploration

This repository wrangles data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics on US-Canada and US-Mexico border crossings from 1996 to present (2024). The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the rate of personal (non-freight or commercial) border crossings over time to understand how certain policy decisions or world events has effected the rate of crossings.

Crossing data is saved as Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.zip.

US_Border_Crossings.qmd will access the Border Crossing Entry Data and construct a report on the rate of border crossings for both US-Mexico and US-Canada from 1996 to present.

The Report is saved as US_Border_Crossings.html
